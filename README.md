# Biomedical Image Classification

Welcome to the **Biomedical Image Classification** repository! This project is focused on biomedical image classification using state-of-the-art deep learning models. We explore and implement different neural network architectures to tackle various challenges in the field of biomedical image analysis.

## Models Implemented

### Vision Transformer (ViT)
The Vision Transformer is a powerful model that applies Transformer architecture to image data. Unlike traditional convolutional models, ViT treats images as sequences of patches and has shown impressive results in various image classification tasks.

### Modified EfficientNet
EfficientNet is a family of models that optimize accuracy and efficiency. In this repository, we use a modified version of EfficientNet tailored for biomedical image classification. This adaptation leverages its efficiency while addressing specific requirements of biomedical imaging.

## Kaggle Competitions

Our approach is designed to compete in Kaggle competitions related to biomedical image classification. The models are fine-tuned to achieve competitive performance on various datasets provided in these competitions.
